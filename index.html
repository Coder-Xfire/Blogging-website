    <h3>Volcano erupts on Spain's Canary Islands</h3>
    <img src="News1.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Cumbre Vieja, which last erupted 50 years ago, straddles a ridge in the south of La Palma island, home to around 80,000 people.

"The eruption started in the Cabeza de Vaca zone, in El Paso," the local government said on its Twitter account, adding that evacuations have started in the areas closest to the volcano.

"People are asked to be extremely careful and to stay away from the eruption zone to avoid needless risk," the government added.

The head of the Canaries region, Angel Victor Torres, said the zone was forested and "sparsely populated".

State television ran live coverage of the eruption during the late afternoon.

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced he would head to the scene later Sunday "to follow developments".

"Given the situation La Palma island, the head of government has delayed his scheduled departure today for New York," to attend the UN General Assembly, a statement said.

"All the services are prepared to act in a coordinated fashion," Sanchez wrote on Twitter.

The interior ministry said 200 members of the security services had been mobilised with a helicopter as back up.</p>

    <h3>California wildfires burn into groves of giant sequoia trees</h3>
    <img src="News2.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The fires lapped into the groves with trees that can be up to 200 feet (61 meters) tall and 2,000 years old, including Oriole Lake Grove in Sequoia National Park and Peyrone North and South groves in the neighboring Sequoia National Forest.

The fire also had reached the forest's Long Meadow Grove, where then-President Bill Clinton signed a proclamation two decades ago establishing a national monument. Fire officials haven't yet been able to determine how much damage was done to the groves, which are in remote, hard-to-reach areas.

"These groves are just as impressive and just as ecologically important to the forest. They just aren't as well-known," Tim Borden, sequoia restoration and stewardship manager for the Save the Redwoods League, told the Bay Area News Group. "My heart sinks when I think about it."

Flames were still about a mile (1.5 kilometers) from the famed Giant Forest, where some 2,000 massive sequoias grow on a plateau high in the mountains of the national park.</p>
